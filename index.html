               <div class="text"><h3>Sustainable Development</h3>
                Sustainable development is an organizing principle that aims to meet human development goals while also enabling natural systems to provide necessary natural resources and ecosystem services to humans.[2] The desired result is a society where living conditions and resources meet human needs without undermining the planetary integrity and stability of the natural system.[3][4] Sustainable development tries to find a balance between economic development, environmental protection, and social well-being. The Brundtland Report in 1987 defined sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".[5][6] The concept of sustainable development nowadays has a focus on economic development, social development and environmental protection for future generations.
    
    Sustainable development was first institutionalized with the Rio Process initiated at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. In 2015 the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (2015 to 2030) and explained how the goals are integrated and indivisible to achieve sustainable development at the global level.[7] The UNGA's 17 goals address the global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.
    
    Sustainable development is interlinked with the normative concept of sustainability. UNESCO formulated a distinction between the two concepts as follows: "Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it."[8] The concept of sustainable development has been criticized in various ways. While some see it as paradoxical (or as an oxymoron) and regard development as inherently unsustainable, others are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far.[9][10] Part of the problem is that "development" itself is not consistently defined.

                <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                Sustainability is a social goal for people to co-exist on Earth over a long time. Specific definitions of this term are disputed and have varied with literature, context, and time.[14][13] Experts often describe sustainability as having three dimensions (or pillars): environmental, economic, and social,[13] and many publications emphasize the environmental dimension.[15][16] In everyday use,[specify] sustainability often focuses on countering major environmental problems, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, loss of ecosystem services, land degradation, and air and water pollution. The idea of sustainability can guide decisions at the global, national, and individual levels (e.g. sustainable living).[17] A related concept is sustainable development, and the terms are often used to mean the same thing.[18] UNESCO distinguishes the two like this: "Sustainability is often thought of as a long-term goal (i.e. a more sustainable world), while sustainable development refers to the many processes and pathways to achieve it.

        <li>It can be achieved by restricting human activities.</li>
        <li>Technological development should be input effective and not input utilising.</li>
        <li>The rate of consumption should not surpass the rate of salvation.</li>
        <li>For renewable resources, the rate of consumption should not surpass the rate of production of renewable substitutes.</li>
        <li>All types of pollution should be minimised.</li>
